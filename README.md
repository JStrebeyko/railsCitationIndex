1. If you don't have any public app in Rails:

Create a simple Rails app to store anonymous citation/quotes, we do not require login or user accounts, just two views:

â€‹view of all citations on index page (starting one)
view to add single citation.
Index page has a link to the page where you can add a new citation, after adding a citation user is redirected to starting page with citations listing. Just adding and displaying all citations is enough.

Optional: add possibility to add comments to citations.

Host your app at Heroku (link here) so we can click it through. As a result, send us a link to the app and a link to the code repository.
